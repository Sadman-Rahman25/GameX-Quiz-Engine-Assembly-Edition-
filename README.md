# GameX-Quiz-Engine-Assembly-Edition-
GameX Quiz Engine is a console-based quiz game developed in x86 Assembly language as part of my microcontroller course project. The program allows users to answer a set of quiz questions, handles keyboard input, tracks scores, and displays results—all using low-level assembly programming constructs. This project highlights fundamental game development principles such as user interface design, logic flow, and data processing at the hardware interaction level. By focusing on direct manipulation of processor registers and memory, this project serves as practical exposure to computer architecture and embedded systems concepts. GameX Quiz Engine is an excellent example for students and enthusiasts interested in understanding how games and interactive applications can be built from the ground up using assembly language. Every feature, from question display to score summary, is implemented with efficiency and clarity, making it an educational tool as well as a fun demonstration of microcontroller programming skills.
